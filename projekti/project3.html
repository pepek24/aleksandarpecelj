                    <h1>Our Work for the Logan Enhancement Project</h1>
                    <p>Major construction on the $512 million Logan Enhancement Project began in 2017 (under CPB Contractors), where Avalon Industries’s plant and expertise have been utilised for various parts of the Queensland-based project. EPH trucks were used throughout the day and night, with our night crew often smashing out 4,000T of profiling before each new day begins.</p></br></br>
                    <p>The major congestion-busting project, powered by over 1300 local jobs, is anticipated to deliver around $1 billion in economic benefits for Queensland over the next 30 years. With the major arterial linking the south and west to Brisbane seeing almost 150,000 vehicles each day the upgrade is needed now more than ever. The Logan Enhancement Project involves numerous upgrades and new roadway features including:</p></br></br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>covering resurfacing efforts</li>
                        <li>interchange upgrades</li>
                        <li>the installation of new safety components and barriers</li>
                        <li>the addition of new service roads</li>
                        <li>new pedestrian and cycle paths</li>
                        <li>the upgrade and relocation of various on and off-ramps</li>
                        <li>new noise barriers</li>
                        <li>upgraded traffic signals and signage</li>
                        <li>new traffic lights</li>
                    </ul></br></br>
                    <p>EPH’s versatile services and fleet have helped numerous activities throughout the project. Key project contractors have notably integrated EPH plant and trucks on hire to undertake tasks like material transport and loading and disposal, with EPH expertise helping to optimise machine fleet utilisation and facilitate project efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The project, located south of Brisbane, was completed in August of 2019, which has seen major upgrades for interchanges at Beaudesert Road and Mt Lindesay Highway, Wembley Road, along with the Logan Motorway and Gateway Motorway interchange. Additionally, the project has delivered new south-facing Compton Road ramps and numerous widening upgrades for the Gateway Motorway. The project has become the first market-led proposal of this nature to be approved and built in Queensland.</p>
                    <img src="../img/project3.jpg" alt="project image">
                    <p>The Pacific Motorway M1/M3/Gateway merge has been running over capacity in the afternoon for a number of years and is renowned as one of the major bottlenecks around Brisbane. The significant delays and uncertainty of travel times have led to the $190 million investment by both Federal and State governments to upgrade the merge. Due for completion in 2020, the Pacific Motorway merge will greatly improve traffic flows and safety, and reduce accidents and travel times.</p></br></br>
                    <p class="bold">Statistics about the project:</p>
                    <p>Start date: Mid 2017</br>
                        End Date: August 2019</br>
                        Cost: $512 million provided by a moderate increase to truck tolls on Logan Motorway and.</br>
